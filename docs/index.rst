Introduction
============
VyOS is an open source network operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux.

VyOS provides a free routing platform that competes directly with other
commercially available solutions from well known network providers. Because
VyOS is run on standard amd64, i586 and ARM systems, it is able to be used
as a router and firewall platform for cloud deployments.
