"In the past serial interface have been defined as ttySx and ttyUSBx where x "
"was an instance number of the serial interface. It was discovered that from "
"system boot to system boot the mapping of USB based serial interfaces will "
"differ, depending which driver was loaded first by the operating system. "
"This will become rather painful if you not only have serial interfaces for a"
" console server connected but in addition also a serial backed :ref:`wwan-"
"interface`."

"To overcome this issue and the fact that in almost 50% of all cheap USB to "
"serial converters there is no serial number programmed, the USB to serial "
"interface is now directly identified by the USB root bridge and bus it "
"connects to. This somehow mimics the new network interface definitions we "
"see in recent Linux distributions."
