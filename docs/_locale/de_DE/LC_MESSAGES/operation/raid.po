"A Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) uses two or more hard disk "
"drives to improve disk speed, store more data, and/or provide fault "
"tolerance. There are several storage schemes possible in a RAID array, each "
"offering a different combination of storage, reliability, and/or "
"performance. The VyOS system supports a “RAID 1” deployment. RAID 1 allows "
"two or more disks to mirror one another to provide system fault tolerance. "
"In a RAID 1 solution, every sector of one disk is duplicated onto every "
"sector of all disks in the array. Provided even one disk in the RAID 1 set "
"is operational, the system continues to run, even through disk replacement "
"(provided that the hardware supports in-service replacement of drives). RAID"
" 1 can be implemented using special hardware or it can be implemented in "
"software. The VyOS system supports software RAID 1 on two disks. The VyOS "
"implementation of RAID 1 allows the following:"
