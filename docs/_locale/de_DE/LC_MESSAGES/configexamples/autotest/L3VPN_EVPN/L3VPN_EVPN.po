"A brief excursion into VRFs: This has been one of the longest-standing "
"feature requests of VyOS (dating back to 2016) which can be described as \"a"
" VLAN for layer 2 is what a VRF is for layer 3\". With VRFs, a router/system"
" can hold multiple, isolated routing tables on the same system. If you "
"wonder what's the difference between multiple tables that people used for "
"policy-based routing since forever, it's that a VRF also isolates connected "
"routes rather than just static and dynamically learned routes, so it allows "
"NICs in different VRFs to use conflicting network ranges without issues."
