"When the underlying ESXi host is approaching ~92% memory utilisation it will"
" start the balloon process in  a 'soft' state to start reclaiming memory "
"from guest operating systems. This causes an artificial pressure using the "
"vmmemctl driver on memory usage on the virtual guest. As VyOS by default "
"does not have a swap file, this vmmemctl pressure is unable to force "
"processes to move in memory data to the paging file, and blindly consumes "
"memory forcing the virtual guest into a low memory state with no way to "
"escape. The balloon can expand to 65% of guest allocated memory, so a VyOS "
"guest running >35% of memory usage, can encounter an out of memory "
"situation, and trigger the kernel oom_kill process. At this point a weighted"
" lottery favouring memory hungry processes will be run with the unlucky "
"winner being terminated by the kernel."
