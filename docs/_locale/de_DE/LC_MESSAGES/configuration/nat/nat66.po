":abbr:`NPTv6 (IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation)` is an address "
"translation technology basedon IPv6 networks, used to convert an IPv6 "
"address prefix in an IPv6 message into another IPv6address prefix. We call "
"this address translation method NAT66. Devices that support the NAT66 "
"function are called NAT66 devices, which can provide NAT66 source and "
"destination address translation functions."
