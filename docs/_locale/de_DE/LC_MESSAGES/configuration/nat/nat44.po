":abbr:`NAT (Network Address Translation)` is a common method of remapping "
"one IP address space into another by modifying network address information "
"in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic "
"routing device. The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid the"
" need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become a "
"popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of"
" IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway "
"can be used for an entire private network."

"IP masquerading is a technique that hides an entire IP address space, "
"usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in "
"another, usually public address space. The hidden addresses are changed into"
" a single (public) IP address as the source address of the outgoing IP "
"packets so they appear as originating not from the hidden host but from the "
"routing device itself. Because of the popularity of this technique to "
"conserve IPv4 address space, the term NAT has become virtually synonymous "
"with IP masquerading."
