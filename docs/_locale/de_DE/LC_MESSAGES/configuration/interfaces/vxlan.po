":abbr:`VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)` is a network virtualization "
"technology that attempts to address the scalability problems associated with"
" large cloud computing deployments. It uses a VLAN-like encapsulation "
"technique to encapsulate OSI layer 2 Ethernet frames within layer 4 UDP "
"datagrams, using 4789 as the default IANA-assigned destination UDP port "
"number. VXLAN endpoints, which terminate VXLAN tunnels and may be either "
"virtual or physical switch ports, are known as :abbr:`VTEPs (VXLAN tunnel "
"endpoints)`."
