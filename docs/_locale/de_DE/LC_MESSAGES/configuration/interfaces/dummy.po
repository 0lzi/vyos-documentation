"The dummy interface is really a little exotic, but rather useful "
"nevertheless. Dummy interfaces are much like the :ref:`loopback-interface` "
"interface, except you can have as many as you want."

"On systems with multiple redundant uplinks and routes, it's a good idea to "
"use a dedicated address for management and dynamic routing protocols. "
"However, assigning that address to a physical link is risky: if that link "
"goes down, that address will become inaccessible. A common solution is to "
"assign the management address to a loopback or a dummy interface and "
"advertise that address via all physical links, so that it's reachable "
"through any of them. Since in Linux-based systems, there can be only one "
"loopback interface, it's better to use a dummy interface for that purpose, "
"since they can be added, removed, and taken up and down independently."
