"Traditionally hardware routers implement IPsec exclusively due to relative "
"ease of implementing it in hardware and insufficient CPU power for doing "
"encryption in software. Since VyOS is a software router, this is less of a "
"concern. OpenVPN has been widely used on UNIX platform for a long time and "
"is a popular option for remote access VPN, though it's also capable of site-"
