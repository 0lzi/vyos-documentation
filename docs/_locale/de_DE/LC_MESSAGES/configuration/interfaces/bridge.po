"A Bridge is a way to connect two Ethernet segments together in a protocol "
"independent way. Packets are forwarded based on Ethernet address, rather "
"than IP address (like a router). Since forwarding is done at Layer 2, all "
"protocols can go transparently through a bridge. The Linux bridge code "
"implements a subset of the ANSI/IEEE 802.1d standard."
