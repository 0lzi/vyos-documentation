"MACsec is an IEEE standard (IEEE 802.1AE) for MAC security, introduced in "
"2006. It defines a way to establish a protocol independent connection "
"between two hosts with data confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity, "
"using GCM-AES-128. MACsec operates on the Ethernet layer and as such is a "
"layer 2 protocol, which means it's designed to secure traffic within a layer"
" 2 network, including DHCP or ARP requests. It does not compete with other "
"security solutions such as IPsec (layer 3) or TLS (layer 4), as all those "
"solutions are used for their own specific use cases."
