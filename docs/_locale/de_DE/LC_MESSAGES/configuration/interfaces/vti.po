"The root cause of the problem is that for VTI tunnels to work, their traffic"
" selectors have to be set to 0.0.0.0/0 for traffic to match the tunnel, even"
" though actual routing decision is made according to netfilter marks. Unless"
" route insertion is disabled entirely, StrongSWAN thus mistakenly inserts a "
"default route through the VTI peer address, which makes all traffic routed "
"to nowhere."
