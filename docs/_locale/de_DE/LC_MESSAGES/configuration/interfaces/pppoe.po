":abbr:`PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet)` is a network protocol "
"for encapsulating PPP frames inside Ethernet frames. It appeared in 1999, in"
" the context of the boom of DSL as the solution for tunneling packets over "
"the DSL connection to the :abbr:`ISPs (Internet Service Providers)` IP "
"network, and from there to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book "
"noted that \"Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, "
"encryption, and compression.\" Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the "
"PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, "
"predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP."
