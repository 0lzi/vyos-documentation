"An advantage of this scheme is that you get a real interface with its own "
"address, which makes it easier to setup static routes or use dynamic routing"
" protocols without having to modify IPsec policies. The other advantage is "
"that it greatly simplifies router to router communication, which can be "
"tricky with plain IPsec because the external outgoing address of the router "
"usually doesn't match the IPsec policy of typical site-to-site setup and you"
" need to add special configuration for it, or adjust the source address for "
"outgoing traffic of your applications. GRE/IPsec has no such problem and is "
"completely transparent for the applications."
