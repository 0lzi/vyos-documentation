":abbr:`SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol)` is a form of :abbr:`VPN "
"(Virtual Private Network)` tunnel that provides a mechanism to transport PPP"
" traffic through an SSL/TLS channel. SSL/TLS provides transport-level "
"security with key negotiation, encryption and traffic integrity checking. "
"The use of SSL/TLS over TCP port 443 allows SSTP to pass through virtually "
"all firewalls and proxy servers except for authenticated web proxies."
