":abbr:`IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)` is a link-state "
"interior gateway routing protocol which is described in ISO10589, "
":rfc:`1195`, :rfc:`5308`. Like OSPF, IS-IS runs the Dijkstra shortest-path "
"first (SPF) algorithm to create a database of the networkâ€™s topology and, "
"from that database, to determine the best (that is, shortest) path to a "
"destination. The routers exchange topology information with their nearest "
"neighbors. IS-IS runs directly on the data link layer (Layer 2). IS-IS "
"addresses are called :abbr:`NETs (Network Entity Titles)` and can be 8 to 20"
" bytes long, but are generally 10 bytes long."
