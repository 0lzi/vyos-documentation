":abbr:`OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)` is a routing protocol for Internet "
"Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and "
"falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within "
"a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in "
":rfc:`2328` (1998) for IPv4. Updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF Version "
"3 in :rfc:`5340` (2008). OSPF supports the :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-"
