":abbr:`RIP (Routing Information Protocol)` is a widely deployed interior "
"gateway protocol. RIP was developed in the 1970s at Xerox Labs as part of "
"the XNS routing protocol. RIP is a distance-vector protocol and is based on "
"the Bellman-Ford algorithms. As a distance-vector protocol, RIP router send "
"updates to its neighbors periodically, thus allowing the convergence to a "
"known topology. In each update, the distance to any given network will be "
"broadcast to its neighboring router."
