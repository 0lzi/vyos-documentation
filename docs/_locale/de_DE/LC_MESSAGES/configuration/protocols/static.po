"Static routes are manually configured routes, which, in general, cannot be "
"updated dynamically from information VyOS learns about the network topology "
"from other routing protocols. However, if a link fails, the router will "
"remove routes, including static routes, from the :abbr:`RIPB (Routing "
"Information Base)` that used this interface to reach the next hop. In "
"general, static routes should only be used for very simple network "
"topologies, or to override the behavior of a dynamic routing protocol for a "
"small number of routes. The collection of all routes the router has learned "
"from its configuration or from its dynamic routing protocols is stored in "
"the RIB. Unicast routes are directly used to determine the forwarding table "
"used for unicast packet forwarding."
