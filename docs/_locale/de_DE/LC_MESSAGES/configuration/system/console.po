"For the average user a serial console has no advantage over a console "
"offered by a directly attached keyboard and screen. Serial consoles are much"
" slower, taking up to a second to fill a 80 column by 24 line screen. Serial"
" consoles generally only support non-proportional ASCII text, with limited "
"support for languages other than English."

"administration of remote computers is usually done using :ref:`ssh`, but "
"there are times when access to the console is the only way to diagnose and "
"correct software failures. Major upgrades to the installed distribution may "
"also require console access."

"If you use USB to serial converters for connecting to your VyOS appliance "
"please note that most of them use software emulation without flow control. "
"This means you should start with a common baud rate (most likely 9600 baud) "
"as otherwise you probably can not connect to the device using high speed "
"baud rates as your serial converter simply can not process this data rate."
