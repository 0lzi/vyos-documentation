"NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around 1996 that "
"provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an "
"interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network "
"administrator can determine things such as the source and destination of "
"traffic, class of service, and the causes of congestion. A typical flow "
"monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components:"
