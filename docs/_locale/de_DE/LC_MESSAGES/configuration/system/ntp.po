":abbr:`NTP (Network Time Protocol`) is a networking protocol for clock "
"synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-"
"latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the "
"oldest Internet protocols in current use."

"NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few "
"milliseconds of :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)`. It uses the "
"intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to "
"select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of "
"variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of "
"milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one "
"millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. "
"Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more."

"The protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can"
" as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider "
"the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive "
"timestamps using :abbr:`UDP (User Datagram Protocol)` on port number 123."
