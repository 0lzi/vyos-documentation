"VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) provides active/backup redundancy "
"for routers. Every VRRP router has a physical IP/IPv6 address, and a virtual"
" address. On startup, routers elect the master, and the router with the "
"highest priority becomes the master and assigns the virtual address to its "
"interface. All routers with lower priorities become backup routers. The "
"master then starts sending keepalive packets to notify other routers that "
"it's available. If the master fails and stops sending keepalive packets, the"
" router with the next highest priority becomes the new master and takes over"
" the virtual address."

"VRRP keepalive packets use multicast, and VRRP setups are limited to a "
"single datalink layer segment. You can setup multiple VRRP groups (also "
"called virtual routers). Virtual routers are identified by a VRID (Virtual "
"Router IDentifier). If you setup multiple groups on the same interface, "
"their VRIDs must be unique if they use the same address family, but it's "
"possible (even if not recommended for readability reasons) to use duplicate "
"VRIDs on different interfaces."
