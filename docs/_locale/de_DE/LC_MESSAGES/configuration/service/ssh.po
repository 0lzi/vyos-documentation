":abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` is a cryptographic network protocol for operating"
" network services securely over an unsecured network. The standard TCP port "
"for SSH is 22. The best known example application is for remote login to "
"computer systems by users."

"SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server "
"architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. "
"Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command "
"execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. The protocol "
"specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1"
" and SSH-2."

"The most visible application of the protocol is for access to shell accounts"
" on Unix-like operating systems, but it sees some limited use on Windows as "
"well. In 2015, Microsoft announced that they would include native support "
"for SSH in a future release."

"SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and for unsecured remote shell "
"protocols such as the Berkeley rlogin, rsh, and rexec protocols. Those "
"protocols send information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them "
"susceptible to interception and disclosure using packet analysis. The "
"encryption used by SSH is intended to provide confidentiality and integrity "
"of data over an unsecured network, such as the Internet."
