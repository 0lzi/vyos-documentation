"Ethernet)` server functionality. It can be used with local authentication "
"(mac-address) or a connected RADIUS server."

"IPoE is a method of delivering an IP payload over an Ethernet-based access "
"network or an access network using bridged Ethernet over Asynchronous "
"Transfer Mode (ATM) without using PPPoE. It directly encapsulates the IP "
"datagrams in Ethernet frames, using the standard :rfc:`894` encapsulation."

"The use of IPoE addresses the disadvantage that PPP is unsuited for "
"multicast delivery to multiple users. Typically, IPoE uses Dynamic Host "
"Configuration Protocol and Extensible Authentication Protocol to provide the"
" same functionality as PPPoE, but in a less robust manner."
