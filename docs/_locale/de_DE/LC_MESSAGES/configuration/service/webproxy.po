"Squid_ is a caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. It has a wide variety of "
"uses, including speeding up a web server by caching repeated requests, "
"caching web, DNS and other computer network lookups for a group of people "
"sharing network resources, and aiding security by filtering traffic. "
"Although primarily used for HTTP and FTP, Squid includes limited support for"
" several other protocols including Internet Gopher, SSL,[6] TLS and HTTPS. "
"Squid does not support the SOCKS protocol."
