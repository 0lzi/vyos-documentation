"Multicast DNS uses the 224.0.0.251 address, which is \"administratively "
"scoped\" and does not leave the subnet. It retransmits mDNS packets from one"
" interface to other interfaces. This enables support for e.g. Apple Airplay "
"devices across multiple VLANs."

"Since the mDNS protocol sends the AA records in the packet itself, the "
"repeater does not need to forge the source address. Instead, the source "
"address is of the interface that repeats the packet."
