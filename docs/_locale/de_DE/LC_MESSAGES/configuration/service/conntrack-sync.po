"One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter framework is "
"connection tracking. Connection tracking allows the kernel to keep track of "
"all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the "
"packets which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this information to"
" translate all related packets in the same way, and iptables can use this "
"information to act as a stateful firewall."

"The connection state however is completely independent of any upper-level "
"state, such as TCP's or SCTP's state. Part of the reason for this is that "
"when merely forwarding packets, i.e. no local delivery, the TCP engine may "
"not necessarily be invoked at all. Even connectionless-mode transmissions "
"such as UDP, IPsec (AH/ESP), GRE and other tunneling protocols have, at "
"least, a pseudo connection state. The heuristic for such protocols is often "
"based upon a preset timeout value for inactivity, after whose expiration a "
"Netfilter connection is dropped."

"Each Netfilter connection is uniquely identified by a (layer-3 protocol, "
"source address, destination address, layer-4 protocol, layer-4 key) tuple. "
"The layer-4 key depends on the transport protocol; for TCP/UDP it is the "
"port numbers, for tunnels it can be their tunnel ID, but otherwise is just "
"zero, as if it were not part of the tuple. To be able to inspect the TCP "
"port in all cases, packets will be mandatorily defragmented."
