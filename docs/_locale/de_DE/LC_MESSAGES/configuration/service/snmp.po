":abbr:`SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)` is an Internet Standard "
"protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on "
"IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. "
"Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches,"
" servers, workstations, printers, and more."

"SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP "
"exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems "
"organized in a management information base (MIB_) which describe the system "
"status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and,"
" in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications."
