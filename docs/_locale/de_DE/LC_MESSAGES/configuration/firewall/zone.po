"In zone-based policy, interfaces are assigned to zones, and inspection "
"policy is applied to traffic moving between the zones and acted on according"
" to firewall rules. A Zone is a group of interfaces that have similar "
"functions or features. It establishes the security borders of a network. A "
"zone defines a boundary where traffic is subjected to policy restrictions as"
" it crosses to another region of a network."
