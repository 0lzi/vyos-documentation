"There once was a network operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux, called "
"Vyatta. [*]_ 2006 onwards, it was a great free software alternative to Cisco"
" IOS and Jupiter JUNOS. It came in two editions: Vyatta Core (previously "
"Vyatta Community Edition) that was completely free software, and Vyatta "
"Subscription Edition that had proprietary features and was only available to"
" paying customers. [*]_"

"Vyatta was acquired by Brocade Communication Systems in 2012. Shortly after,"
" Brocade renamed Vyatta Subscription Edition to Brocade vRouter, "
"discontinued Vyatta Core and shut down the community forum without a notice."

"It's worth noting that by the time Brocade acquired Vyatta, development of "
"Vyatta Core was already stagnated. Vyatta Subscription Edition (and thus, "
"Vyatta development as a whole) had been replacing core components with "
"proprietary software, meaning few features made it to Vyatta Core, and those"
" that did were bug-ridden and hamstrung."

"and IGMP proxy, as well as experimental support for VXLAN and DMVPN (the "
"latter of which was also broken in Vyatta Core due to its reliance on a "
